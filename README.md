Review:The course covered A LOT of content. Is build for people with background in the area so he goes fast and
tries to cover as much as possible. But a lot of the content is pretty much similar to other OOP languages like Java ans
C++, so I was able to cover much of it quite fast. The only downside is that the code became a little mesier when we 
start to see WPF. It happens because the ovbjetive here is to explore the possibilities of the .NET framework
and not create a conciese projects  projects (I planning to do that myself, maybe converting some old Java and Python projects to 
.NET)
